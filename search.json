    "section": "",
    "text": "Anyone watching the Avalanche last season could easily tell this team had a ton of talent, but compared to the other Avalanche teams throughout the years, was the 2021-22 team really that much better?\nThis also offers up the question of, statistically, were they the best team in the entire franchise?\nLet’s take a look at the numbers.\n[Hockey Reference’s Colorado Avalanche Site] (https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/COL/history.html) produces many different statistics for all seasons within the Avalanche franchise.\nThe first question we will ask is which team had the best win percentage? To find the teams with the best win percentage we will divide the number of wins by the number of games played, here are the top 10.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\navstable <- read_csv(\"Avs Data - Sheet1.csv\")\n\navsnew <- avstable %>%\n  mutate(\n    WinsPct = W/GP\n  )\n\navsnewest <- avsnew %>%\n  select(Season, WinsPct) %>%\n  top_n(10)%>%\n   arrange(desc(WinsPct))\n\navsnewest %>% \n  gt() %>% \n  cols_label(\n    Season = \"Season\",\n    WinsPct = \"Win Percentage\"\n  ) %>%\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"The most recent Stanley Cup winners are second best\",\n    subtitle = \"The 2021-22 Avalanche team slightly missed being top dog based on win percentage.\"\n  ) %>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) %>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) %>%\n  tab_source_note( source_note = md(\"**By:** Rose Kyllo  |  **Source:** Hockey Reference\"))%>%\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     ))%>%\n  opt_row_striping() %>% \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") %>%\n    fmt_percent(\n    columns = c(WinsPct),\n    decimals = 1\n  )%>%\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"blue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Season == \"2021-22\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      The most recent Stanley Cup winners are second best\n    \n    \n      The 2021-22 Avalanche team slightly missed being top dog based on win percentage.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Season\n      Win Percentage\n    \n  \n  \n    2020-21\n69.6%\n    2021-22\n68.3%\n    2013-14\n63.4%\n    2000-01\n63.4%\n    1994-95\n62.5%\n    2019-20\n60.0%\n    1996-97\n59.8%\n    1995-96\n57.3%\n    1992-93\n56.0%\n    2001-02\n54.9%\n  \n  \n    \n      By: Rose Kyllo  |  Source: Hockey Reference\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nThe 2021-22 team came in at a close second to the 2020-21 team. Although less games were played by the 2020-21 team (56 games), they still won more. The 2013-14 team was their next closest competition with the same amount of games played as the 2021-22 team (82 games) but they only came out with 52 wins.\nBut what if we compared points and wins? How will the 2021-22 team rank then? This bubble chart with the size of dots being the amount of wins, the y-axis being points percentage and the x-axis being total points will show how they size up against their competition.\n\n\nCode\navs <- read_csv(\"Avs Data - Sheet1.csv\")\n\nbest <- avs %>% filter(Season == \"2021-22\")\n\navs %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  summarise(\n    Points = mean(PTS), \n    PointsPCT = mean(`PTS%`)\n    )\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  Points PointsPCT\n   <dbl>     <dbl>\n1   82.3     0.535\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=avs, \n    aes(x=PTS, y=`PTS%`, size=W), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.3) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=best, \n    aes(x=PTS, y=`PTS%`, size=W), \n    color=\"blue\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 82.25581) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5348605)  +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=best, \n    aes(x=PTS, y=`PTS%`, label=Season)\n  ) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Total Points\", \n    y=\"Points Percentage\", \n    title=\"2021-22 was a great year for the Avalanche franchise\", \n    subtitle=\"Last seasons team was the best of the best based on PTS%, PTS, and number of wins.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Hockey Reference | By: Rose Kyllo\"\n    )+\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nThe answer is, they come out on top. Points percentage is calculated by dividing the total points in the PTS column with the total possible points for all games played (2 pts per game). The 2021-22 team had the best points percentage, most total points, and the most amount of wins out of all the other teams.\nThe simple rating system is a rating that takes into account the average goal differential and strength of schedule, zero is average. Let’s use this bar chart to see how the 2021-22 team compares.\n\n\nCode\navsbar <- read_csv(\"Avs Data - Sheet1.csv\")\n\navalanche <- avsbar %>%\n  group_by(Season) \n\nseason <- avalanche%>%\n  filter(Season == \"2021-22\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=avalanche, aes(x=Season, weight=SRS)) + \n  geom_bar(data=season, aes(x=Season, weight=SRS),fill= \"blue\")  +\n  coord_flip()+ \n  labs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"Simple Rating System\", \n    title=\"The 2021-22 team was above average, but not the best\", \n    subtitle=\"Last season's Avs were close, but were beat by four other teams from throughout the years.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Hockey Reference | By: Rose Kyllo\"\n    )+\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nAdmittedly enough, the 2021-22 team did not have the highest SRS but they were definitely above average.\nOverall, last season’s team was very talented but these statistics show they were not the best team in the franchise."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Anyone watching a NWSL game can see that Morgan and Pugh are exceptional players, but did they really deserve to be in the running for MVP?\nLet’s take a look at some numbers.\nSports Reference’s soccer site produces all the different statistics one would need to evaluate if a player should be considered for an award. For example, things such as total goals in a season and their position.\nTo compare Morgan and Pugh’s total goals on a larger scale, we will compare their number of goals to every other player in the league’s.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nset.seed(1234)\n\nsoccer<-read_csv(\"2022.csv\")\n\nactiveplayers <- soccer %>% \n  filter(\n    MP > 5 & \n      Gls...11 > 0 & \n      is.na(Pos) == FALSE)\n\nmalandalex <- activeplayers %>% \n  filter(Player == \"Mallory Pugh\"|Player==\"Alex Morgan\")\n\nmal<- activeplayers%>%\n  filter(Player==\"Mallory Pugh\")\n\nalex<-activeplayers%>%\n  filter(Player==\"Alex Morgan\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=activeplayers, \n    groupOnX=TRUE, \n    aes(x=Pos, y=Gls...11), color=\"grey\") + \n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=malandalex, \n    groupOnX=TRUE, \n    aes(x=Pos, y=Gls...11), color=\"hot pink\") + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=malandalex, \n    aes(x=Pos, y=Gls...11, label=Player)) +\n  labs(\n    title=\"Alex and Mallory dominated goals for the offense\",\n    subtitle=\"The top two offensive players found the back of the net far more than the others in their position.\", \n    caption=\"Source: FBRef | Rose Kyllo \", \n    x=\"Position\", \n    y=\"Goals\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.title.position = \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nMorgan and Pugh were unsurprisingly at the top of their position. Morgan was actually the top scorer of the entire league, while Pugh was equal with one forward and got trumped by another. This chart shows they definitely deserved to be in the running, but they had some tough competition.\nThe next question to ask is, how did the two rank compared to other players? I used a total z-score to rank the players based on the average of goals scored per match, the average of assists per match and the average minutes played per match. The ranking uses a statistical measure of the distance from the mean called a z-score. Here’s the top 10 players with the best z-scores.\n\n\nCode\npermatch <- soccer %>% \n  mutate(\n    goalspermatch = Gls...11/MP,\n    assistspermatch = Ast...12/MP,\n    minutespermatch = Min/MP\n  ) %>%\n  select(Player, Squad, goalspermatch, assistspermatch, minutespermatch)\n\nplayerzscore <- permatch %>%\n  mutate(\n    goalszscore = as.numeric(scale(goalspermatch, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    assistszscore = as.numeric(scale(assistspermatch, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    minuteszscore = as.numeric(scale(minutespermatch, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    TotalZscore =  goalszscore + assistszscore +  minuteszscore\n  ) %>% ungroup() \n\ntop10<- playerzscore %>% arrange(desc(TotalZscore))%>%top_n(10)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nzbar <- top10\n\ntoptwo<- zbar %>%\n  filter(Player==\"Mallory Pugh\"| Player==\"Alex Morgan\")\n\n  ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=zbar, aes(x=Player, weight=TotalZscore)) +\n    geom_bar(data=toptwo, aes(x=Player, weight=TotalZscore),fill= \"pink\")+\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Player\", \n    y=\"Total Zscore\", \n    title=\"Morgan and Pugh top the NWSL \", \n    subtitle=\"Alex Morgan and Mallory Pugh showed themselves to be among the elite in the sport.\", \n    caption=\"Source: FBRef | Rose Kyllo\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nPugh took the cake in this one with the highest z-score. No surprise here, Morgan took second. This is just another example to prove that the two players were hard fighters in this MVP competition, and also against each other.\nThe last question to ask here is, are these statistics really fair in the context of playing time? When one player has less playing time than another, but they score many goals in that short time, they will look statistically more impressive than others. Let’s look at how Morgan and Pugh’s playing time stacked up against one other.\n\n\nCode\nmps <- soccer %>% \n  group_by(Player, Squad) %>% \n  summarise(\n    TotalGames = sum(MP), \n    TotalStarts = sum(Starts), \n    Total90s = sum(`90s`))%>% \n  mutate(\n    TotalMatches = TotalGames, \n    TotalStarts = TotalStarts)\n\npughandmorgan <- mps %>% filter(Player == \"Mallory Pugh\"|Player == \"Alex Morgan\")\n\nAlex <- pughandmorgan %>% filter(Player==\"Alex Morgan\")\n\nMal <- pughandmorgan %>% filter(Player==\"Mallory Pugh\")\n\nmps %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  summarise(\n    matches = mean(TotalMatches), \n    starts = mean(TotalStarts)\n    )\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  matches starts\n    <dbl>  <dbl>\n1    12.6   9.25\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=mps, \n    aes(x=TotalMatches, y=TotalStarts, size=Total90s), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.3) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=pughandmorgan, \n    aes(x=TotalMatches, y=TotalStarts, size=Total90s), \n    color=\"hot pink\")+ \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 12.61465) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 9.248408)+\n  geom_text_repel(data=pughandmorgan,aes(x=TotalMatches, y=TotalStarts, label=Player)) +\n      geom_encircle(data=Alex, aes(x=TotalMatches-.05, y=TotalStarts+.5), s_shape=.1, expand=.01, colour=\"pink\")+\n  geom_encircle(data=Mal, aes(x=TotalMatches-.05, y=TotalStarts+-1), s_shape=.1, expand=.01, colour=\"pink\")+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Total Matches Played\", \n    y=\"Total Starts\", \n    title=\"Morgan and Pugh were noticeable on the field this season\", \n    subtitle=\"The two played full games and started more than the average, but not as much as some others.\", \n    caption=\"Source: FBRef | Rose Kyllo\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nPugh had a few less matches played and starts than Morgan, but the full 90s that were played were equal. They both played more than the average player, and were not far off from each other. This means their respective statistics are fair and telling of their out of this world ability.\nThere is no doubt that Morgan and Pugh definitely deserved to be in the running for MVP, the statistics prove it. If they continue to perform like they did this season, maybe next one of them will take home the honor."
