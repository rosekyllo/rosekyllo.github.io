    "title": "Was the 2021-22 Colorado Avalanche Team the Best in the Entire Franchise?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Anyone watching the Avalanche last season could easily tell this team had a ton of talent, but compared to the other Avalanche teams throughout the years, was the 2021-22 team really that much better?\nThis also offers up the question of, statistically, were they the best team in the entire franchise?\nLet’s take a look at the numbers.\n[Hockey Reference’s Colorado Avalanche Site] (https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/COL/history.html) produces many different statistics for all seasons within the Avalanche franchise.\nThe first question we will ask is which team had the best win percentage? To find the teams with the best win percentage we will divide the number of wins by the number of games played, here are the top 10.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\navstable <- read_csv(\"Avs Data - Sheet1.csv\")\n\navsnew <- avstable %>%\n  mutate(\n    WinsPct = W/GP\n  )\n\navsnewest <- avsnew %>%\n  select(Season, WinsPct) %>%\n  top_n(10)%>%\n   arrange(desc(WinsPct))\n\navsnewest %>% \n  gt() %>% \n  cols_label(\n    Season = \"Season\",\n    WinsPct = \"Win Percentage\"\n  ) %>%\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"The most recent Stanley Cup winners are second best\",\n    subtitle = \"The 2021-22 Avalanche team slightly missed being top dog based on win percentage.\"\n  ) %>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) %>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) %>%\n  tab_source_note( source_note = md(\"**By:** Rose Kyllo  |  **Source:** Hockey Reference\"))%>%\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     ))%>%\n  opt_row_striping() %>% \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") %>%\n    fmt_percent(\n    columns = c(WinsPct),\n    decimals = 1\n  )%>%\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"blue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Season == \"2021-22\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      The most recent Stanley Cup winners are second best\n    \n    \n      The 2021-22 Avalanche team slightly missed being top dog based on win percentage.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Season\n      Win Percentage\n    \n  \n  \n    2020-21\n69.6%\n    2021-22\n68.3%\n    2013-14\n63.4%\n    2000-01\n63.4%\n    1994-95\n62.5%\n    2019-20\n60.0%\n    1996-97\n59.8%\n    1995-96\n57.3%\n    1992-93\n56.0%\n    2001-02\n54.9%\n  \n  \n    \n      By: Rose Kyllo  |  Source: Hockey Reference\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nThe 2021-22 team came in at a close second to the 2020-21 team. Although less games were played by the 2020-21 team (56 games), they still won more. The 2013-14 team was their next closest competition with the same amount of games played as the 2021-22 team (82 games) but they only came out with 52 wins.\nBut what if we compared points and wins? How will the 2021-22 team rank then? This bubble chart with the size of dots being the amount of wins, the y-axis being points percentage and the x-axis being total points will show how they size up against their competition.\n\n\nCode\navs <- read_csv(\"Avs Data - Sheet1.csv\")\n\nbest <- avs %>% filter(Season == \"2021-22\")\n\navs %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  summarise(\n    Points = mean(PTS), \n    PointsPCT = mean(`PTS%`)\n    )\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  Points PointsPCT\n   <dbl>     <dbl>\n1   82.3     0.535\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=avs, \n    aes(x=PTS, y=`PTS%`, size=W), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.3) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=best, \n    aes(x=PTS, y=`PTS%`, size=W), \n    color=\"blue\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 82.25581) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5348605)  +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=best, \n    aes(x=PTS, y=`PTS%`, label=Season)\n  ) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Total Points\", \n    y=\"Points Percentage\", \n    title=\"2021-22 was a great year for the Avalanche franchise\", \n    subtitle=\"Last seasons team was the best of the best based on PTS%, PTS, and number of wins.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Hockey Reference | By: Rose Kyllo\"\n    )+\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nThe answer is, they come out on top. Points percentage is calculated by dividing the total points in the PTS column with the total possible points for all games played (2 pts per game). The 2021-22 team had the best points percentage, most total points, and the most amount of wins out of all the other teams.\nThe simple rating system is a rating that takes into account the average goal differential and strength of schedule, zero is average. Let’s use this bar chart to see how the 2021-22 team compares.\n\n\nCode\navsbar <- read_csv(\"Avs Data - Sheet1.csv\")\n\navalanche <- avsbar %>%\n  group_by(Season) \n\nseason <- avalanche%>%\n  filter(Season == \"2021-22\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=avalanche, aes(x=Season, weight=SRS)) + \n  geom_bar(data=season, aes(x=Season, weight=SRS),fill= \"blue\")  +\n  coord_flip()+ \n  labs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"Simple Rating System\", \n    title=\"The 2021-22 team was above average, but not the best\", \n    subtitle=\"Last season's Avs were close, but were beat by four other teams from throughout the years.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Hockey Reference | By: Rose Kyllo\"\n    )+\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nAdmittedly enough, the 2021-22 team did not have the highest SRS but they were definitely above average.\nOverall, last season’s team was very talented but these statistics show they were not the best team in the franchise."
